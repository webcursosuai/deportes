	* Cancelling a class 90 minutes before it starts will substract half (0.5) an attendance.<br>

	Each row represents a day of the week.
	As the image shows, the highlighted row corresponds to every wednesday of the year.<br>
	<img src="img/col.png"><br>
	Each column is a week, starting with sunday at the top and ending with saturday at the bottom.
	Every column has 7 spaces down, for the 7 days of the week.<br>
	<img src="img/punishment.png"><br>
	One cell corresponds to one day. When there are no attendances that day, it will have no color (grey background).
	One valid attendance (+1) in that day will display a blue colored cell, while one punishment (-1) will display an orange colored cell.
	Half an attendance (+0.5) has a light blue color, and half a punishment (-0.5) has a light orange color.<br>
	<img src="img/blank.png"><br>
	A null attendance (0) has a white color, as the image shows. They are slightly different from the grey, empty ones.<br>
	<b>Note</b> that the graph displays <b>valid</b> attendances. If you attend once (+1) but also get half a punishment (-0.5) that day,
	the graph will display the corresponding half attendance (+0.5).<br>
	Hovering the cursor over a cell will show the date and attendance value detail on that day.';
